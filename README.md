This code seeks to compare the energy/carbon emissions differences in the Adam vs AdamW Optimizer for CPUs and GPUs. The data was preprocessed from previous work in Washington.

You should install CodeCarbon dependencies.

GPU VERSION of COLAB:
The dataset used for this project is in this folder:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bHlHNYKqFIL8beSLTkl4Tx_6i_BdHJnR?usp=drive_link
Please put this folder in your google drive/local machine and update the directory so that that you do not need to preprocess data.

Before refers to using Adam as the Optmizer.
After refers to using AdamW as the Optimizer.

Attached are the csv files for before and after for CPU and GPU.

There were no significant changes in results.
